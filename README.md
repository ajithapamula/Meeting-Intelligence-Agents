Meeting Intelligence Agent

Version: 1.0
Author: Ajitha
Project Type: Multi-Agent System + MCP Integration
Language: Python 3.10+

📖 Project Overview

The Meeting Intelligence Agent is a corporate productivity tool designed to process meeting transcripts and generate structured, actionable outputs. It uses a multi-agent system approach to handle different aspects of meeting intelligence:

Notes Extraction – Summarizes key discussion points.

Action Item Identification – Detects tasks, deadlines, and responsible members.

Summary Generation – Creates concise, human-readable meeting summaries.

MCP Integration – Simulates a Model Context Protocol for automating tasks like saving reports or sending emails.

Goal: Reduce repetitive manual work for managers, HR, or project teams, and provide instant meeting insights.
